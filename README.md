## Why Use the 20-20-20 Rule?

The 20-20-20 rule is a well-established method recommended by optometrists and endorsed by the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Optometric Association to reduce eye strain caused by prolonged screen time. By taking a 20-second break to look at something 20 feet away every 20 minutes, users can alleviate eye fatigue and prevent digital eye strain. Integrating this rule into the GNOME desktop environment through regular notifications will help users maintain better eye health during extended computer use.

For more information about the 20-20-20 rule, you can refer to [NVISION Eye Centers](https://www.nvisioncenters.com/education/20-20-20-rule/).
